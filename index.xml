You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you&amp;rsquo;d like to get.
The majority of configuration can be be found under data/config.yaml. An annotated example configuration is shown below.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! You can head to &amp;lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/quartz to see it live.
Enable GitHub Actions By default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the &amp;lsquo;Actions&amp;rsquo; tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!

Obsidian I strongly recommend using Obsidian as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of my local files.
üîó How to link your Obsidian Vault
Of course, all the files are in Markdown so you could just use your favourite text editor of choice, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop you!</description></item><item><title>Obsidian Vault Integration</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/obsidian/</guid><description>Setup Obsidian is the preferred way to use Quartz. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.
New Vault If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an existing Vault, download Obsidian and create a new Vault in the /content folder that you created and cloned during the setup .
Linking an existing Vault The easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of our files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the /content folder.</description></item><item><title>Quartz Documentation</title><link>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/moc/directory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/moc/directory/</guid><description>Setup Welcome to Quartz!
