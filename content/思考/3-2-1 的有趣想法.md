## 想法

- If you're searching for more time this year, start with a clean slate and choose what to add to your days rather than starting with a full schedule and trying to figure out what to eliminate.
  - 如果你今年正在寻找更多的时间，那就从一块干净的石板开始，选择在你的日子里增加什么，而不是从一个完整的时间表开始，试图找出要取消的东西。

- I was reviewing some old notes to myself recently and I found this one:You just need to have the courage to eliminate everything that doesn't directly feed what you really want.
  - 我最近回顾了一些给自己的旧笔记，我发现了这一条：你只需要有勇气消除那些不能直接满足你真正想要的东西的一切。

- When something fascinates you, pay attention to the details. The person who thinks, "That was cool" is a consumer. The person who thinks, "How did they make something that cool?" is on the path to being a creator.
  - 当一件事情让你着迷时，要注意细节。认为 "这很酷 "的人是一个消费者。而认为 "他们是如何做出这么酷的东西的？"的人则是在成为创造者的道路上。

- Don't just taste the recipe, look for the ingredients."
  - 不要只是品尝食谱，要寻找其中的成分"。

- "You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."
  - 你永远不会通过对抗现有的现实来改变事情。要改变一些东西，就要建立一个新的模式，使现有的模式变得过时。

- "It doesn't make sense to continue wanting something if you're not willing to do what it takes to get it.
  - "如果你不愿意做任何事情来得到它，那么继续想要它是没有意义的。

- "There seemed to be endless obstacles preventing me from living with my eyes open, but as I gradually followed up clue after clue it seemed that the root cause of them all was fear."
  - 似乎有无穷无尽的障碍阻止我睁开眼睛生活，但当我逐渐追踪一条又一条的线索时，似乎所有的根源都是恐惧。

- "Never be limited by other people's limited imaginations. If you adopt their attitudes, then the possibility won't exist because you'll have already shut it out… You can hear other people's wisdom, but you've got to re-evaluate the world for yourself."
  - 永远不要被其他人的有限想象力所限制。如果你采用他们的态度，那么这种可能性就不会存在，因为你已经把它拒之门外了……你可以听到别人的智慧，但你必须为自己重新评价这个世界。

- "Before you throw more time at the problem, throw more focused action at the problem. You don’t need more time, you need fewer distractions."
  - 在你花更多的时间解决问题之前，先把更多的注意力集中在问题上。你不需要更多的时间，你需要更少的干扰。

- "With the creative process, the key is to create a lot and edit a lot. Make more than you need, then remove everything that isn't exceptional."
  - 在创作过程中，关键是要大量创作，大量编辑。创作超过你的需要，然后删除一切不出众的东西。

- "When you need to learn quickly, learn from others. When you need to learn deeply, learn from experience."
  - "当你需要快速学习的时候，向别人学习。当你需要深入学习时，就从经验中学习"。

- "It's rarely doing the work that is hard, it's starting the work. Once you begin, it’s often less painful to continue working. This is why—in the beginning—it is often more important to build the habit of getting started than it is to worry about whether or not you are doing enough."
  - "很少工作是困难的，难的是开始工作。一旦你开始工作，继续工作往往就不那么痛苦了。这就是为什么在开始时，养成开始工作的习惯往往比担心你是否做得够多更重要。

- Envision where you are headed in great detail. Don't talk yourself out of it. Don't encourage yourself to be realistic. You will have to wrestle with reality soon enough. Don't be your own bottleneck at this stage.
  - 详细地设想你要去的地方。不要劝说自己放弃。不要鼓励自己要现实一点。你将不得不很快与现实搏斗。在这个阶段，不要成为你自己的瓶颈。

- "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."
  - 请求宽恕比获得许可更容易。

- "Everything is a lesson. Learn enough lessons and the failures become useful."
  - 每件事都是一个教训。学到足够的教训，失败就会变得有用。

- Greek philosopher **Epicurus** on desire and contentment: "Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for."
  - 不要因为渴望你没有的东西而破坏你所拥有的东西；记住你现在所拥有的东西曾经是你只希望得到的东西之一。

- "A phrase I heard recently and found useful: I agree with the idea, but I disagree with the tone. Many ideas get dismissed because they are delivered in a cocky or hostile or dismissive tone—or because of who delivers them. Separate substance from style."
  - 我最近听到的一句话，发现很有用：我同意这个想法，但我不同意这个语气。
  - 许多想法被驳回是因为它们是以傲慢、敌意或轻蔑的语气提出的--或者是因为谁提出的。
  - 把内容和风格分开。

- Scientist and systems engineer, **Donella Meadows**, on intellectual humility and learning from others: "Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own."
  - “永远记住，你所知道的一切，以及每个人所知道的一切，都只是一个模型。把你的模型放在可以看到的地方。邀请其他人挑战你的假设并添加他们自己的假设。”

  - “如果你需要 10 个东西，就做 30 个。然后挑选最好的。”

- "Many people won't attempt something unless they can find an example of someone else who is already doing it. Rely on this type of thinking too much and you'll never do anything interesting.
  - “许多人不会尝试某事，除非他们能找到其他人已经在做的例子。过分依赖这种思维方式，你永远不会做任何有趣的事情。

- Your path through life is unique. It is important to extract lessons from the experiences of others, but you can't wait for a perfect example to take action. You are the example."
  - 你的人生道路是独一无二的。从别人的经验中吸取教训很重要，但你不能等到一个完美的例子才采取行动。你就是榜样。”

- "People usually judge you based on where you are at currently, not what you could become eventually. Don't let one comment stop you from trying. File it away or use it as fuel. Focus on getting better. Someone else's analysis of your current position doesn't tell you anything about your current potential."
  - “人们通常根据你目前所处的位置来评判你，而不是你最终会成为什么样的人。不要让一条评论阻止你尝试。把它归档或用它作为燃料。专注于变得更好。别人对你的分析当前的职位并不能告诉你任何有关你当前潜力的信息。”

- "One of the great balancing acts in life is to be cautious and daring at the same time.
  - “生活中最伟大的平衡行为之一就是同时保持谨慎和大胆。

- Cautious enough to avoid stupid mistakes, prevent burnout, and maintain a margin of safety.
  - 足够谨慎，避免愚蠢的错误，防止倦怠，并保持安全边际。

- Daring enough to bet on yourself, to do the things you would regret leaving undone, and to be willing to be uncomfortable in the short term so you can learn and grow in the long term."
  - 敢于把赌注押在自己身上，去做那些不做就会后悔的事情，愿意在短期内感到不舒服，这样你才能长期学习和成长。”

- "Curiosity is the beginning of knowledge. Action is the beginning of change."
  - “好奇心是知识的开始。行动是改变的开始。”

- "If you feel safe in the area that you’re working in, you’re not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you’re capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth, and when you don’t feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you’re just about in the right place to do something exciting."
  - “如果你在你工作的区域感到安全，那么你就没有在正确的区域工作。总是比你认为自己能够进入的地方更深入水中。稍微离开一点当你感觉自己的脚没有完全接触到底部时，你就处于正确的位置，可以做一些令人兴奋的事情了。”

  - 当你真正对某件事感到好奇时，很容易找到改进的方法。不要问自己：“我怎样才能做得更好？”首先问：“我怎样才能对此更好奇？”
